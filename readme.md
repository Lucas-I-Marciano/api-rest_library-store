# üìö Bookstore API

This project involves creating a REST API using MongoDB as the database. The API is designed for a bookstore, chosen for the variety of information that can be accessed in a bookstore catalog. I used Express to make my API more robust and to further develop my skills with this framework, and MongoDB to explore non-relational databases.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **src**: Contains all the source code.
- **config**: Database connection configuration using environment variables.
- **controllers**: Define how requests interact with the database.
- **errors**: Custom error handling for routes.
- **middlewares**: Process requests before sending responses.
- **models**: Define the structure of MongoDB collections.
- **routes**: List all HTTP request routes, organized by collection.
- **app.js**: Main application file.
- **server.js**: Sets up the local server.
- **test.py**: Optional Python script for testing API requests. It's recommended to use Postman or Insomnia for a more user-friendly experience.
